# Password-Manager

This password manager uses the crypto module in Node.js to encrypt and decrypt the passwords using the AES 256-bit encryption algorithm. 
The passwords are stored in a JavaScript object, and the object can be saved to a file using the fs module. 
The password manager also provides functionality to load the passwords from a file.

Please note that this is just a basic implementation and should not be used in a production environment without proper testing and additional security measures. 
Additionally, you should replace the hardcoded secret key with a secure key that is generated dynamically.
